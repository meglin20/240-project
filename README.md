# NACRO Website Redesign
This is our project for 67-240: Mobile App Design and Development. Our team is theme 4, team 1, and are working to redesign NACRO's website. To view the website, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Google Chrome probably works best and most consistently.

Note that we have currently only redesigned the home, virtual conference, and upcoming events pages, so only these links regarding these pages will be clickable.
